PageRank Calculation

Code that calculates PR for a set of pages from the Apache Foundation that have been crawled by a search engine. The schema of the dataset, with fields being tab separated, is as follows:
First Field: URL
Second Field: Starting PageRank (1.0 for every page)
Third Field: List of links found at that URL

Output the PR of each page in the list sorted in descending order by the PR values.
